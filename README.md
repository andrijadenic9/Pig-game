# Dice Game Challenge

Welcome to the Dice Game Challenge repository! Engage in a thrilling two-player dice rolling game where players take turns rolling the dice to accumulate points. The objective is to reach a score of 101 or higher to win.

## Overview

The Dice Game Challenge offers an exciting competitive experience for two players. Roll the dice, but be cautious - if you roll a 1, your turn ends, and the other player gets a chance. Accumulate points with each roll, and decide when to "bank" your points before risking losing them. The first player to reach a score of 101 or more wins the game.

## Features

- **Player Names**:
  - Before starting the game, each player enters their name and saves it by pressing Enter.
  
- **Dice Rolling Rules**:
  - Players take turns rolling the dice.
  - If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and the other player takes over.
  
- **Point Accumulation and Banking**:
  - Accumulate points by rolling the dice and getting numbers other than 1.
  - Decide when to "bank" your accumulated points and store them in a secure score.
  - Once points are banked, it's the other player's turn.

- **Winning Condition**:
  - The game ends when one player's total score reaches 101 or more.
  - The player with the highest score at that point wins the game.
